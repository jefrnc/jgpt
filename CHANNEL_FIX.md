# Bot Channel Configuration Fix

## Issue
Bot was sending alerts to personal chat instead of the "Premarket Pulse - Small Caps" channel.

## Fix
Updated `.env` file:
```
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=-1002878039167  # Channel ID for "Premarket Pulse - Small Caps"
```

## Verification
âœ… Test message sent successfully to correct channel

## Next Steps
Bot is now configured to send all gap alerts to the proper channel during premarket hours (4:00-9:30 AM ET).
